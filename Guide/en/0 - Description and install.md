# Description

The Regexoop library is similar to regex in that you create a search pattern just like in regex. The development of this library began as an idea to make text search easier and more accessible to a wide range of people. At the moment, regex has a high entry threshold for something more or less worthwhile in terms of text search. 

Once you have written a pattern in regex, you cannot easily read it or somehow tinker with it without making a lot of effort. This project is like a proof concept. The library will make it possible to reduce the mental burden of writing, support for search templates.

# Online tutorial

Documentation is available in the folder Guide or on site [regexoop.com](http://regexoop.com)

# Install

The library regexoop can be installed as Nuget packet [regexoop on nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Regexoop/) or clone the project and connect as a solution to your main project. [regexoop on github](https://github.com/askolt/Regexoop)

# Project versioning

Despite a last commit has version 0.0.2 I chosed to follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org)

To make it convenient for you to move around and understand what has already been implemented, I left such a table in the body of each documentation.

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| Release | 0.0.1 |

So you will understand what you can already use. Luck with searching!ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜Ž

# Contribution

Since this library is just a concept, I don't expect you to write code, it seems even better to me. After all, who knows how it will be next. But I am waiting for active proposals to improve the syntax, and if you have knowledge of any foreign language, then translation. Thanks.
