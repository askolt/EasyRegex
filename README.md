# Description
The Regexoop library is similar to regex in that you create a search pattern just like in regex. The development of this library began as an idea to make text search easier and more accessible to a wide range of people. At the moment, regex has a high entry threshold for something more or less worthwhile in terms of text search. 

Once you have written a pattern in regex, you cannot easily read it or somehow tinker with it without making a lot of effort. This project is like a proof concept. The library will make it possible to reduce the mental burden of writing, support for search templates.
# Online tutorial

Documentation is available in the folder Guide or on site [regexoop.com](http://regexoop.com)

# Install

The library regexoop can be installed as Nuget packet [regexoop on nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Regexoop/) or clone the project and connect as a solution to your main project. [regexoop on github](https://github.com/askolt/Regexoop)

# Project versioning
The final version as a concept is the version v0.1.0.

The library started from version v0.0.1 and will move sideways according to the pattern 0.0.\* Up until all the documents from the documentation are implemented. If you have any suggestions for more competent versioning, create an issue on the project page.

To make it convenient for you to move around and understand what has already been implemented, I left such a table in the body of each documentation.

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| Release | 0.0.1 |

So you will understand what you can already use. Luck with searching!ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜Ž


# Contribution

Since this library is just a concept, I don't expect you to write code, it seems even better to me. After all, who knows how it will be next. But I am waiting for active proposals to improve the syntax, and if you have knowledge of any foreign language, then translation. Thanks.
